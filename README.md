# digital-map-editor

> Project was inspired by open-source project called UMP, which deals with a free map for users. The application that I decided to built is a graphical user interface for a mocked-up digital map editor. Code of the application in this repository is part of my master thesis called "Comparative performance analysis of front-end frameworks applied to digital map editor", it represents React part of the project, that also consists of Angular and Vue applications.<br/>
